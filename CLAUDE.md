# RouterOS LSP — Architecture & Agent Context

## Agent Roles

**Copilot is the primary implementation agent.** It runs in-IDE and as hosted agents on github.com and does most of the routine code changes. **Claude Code is the secondary agent for design and review** — DESIGN.md authorship, architectural decisions, focused refactors, and PR code review. When in doubt, prefer pushing implementation decisions into DESIGN.md (Claude territory) and keep BACKLOG.md actionable (Copilot territory).

This matters for instruction-writing: docs in this repo must be model-agnostic. Where a rule applies to only one, label it `Copilot:` or `Claude:` inline.

## What This Project Does

RouterOS LSP is a Language Server Protocol server for MikroTik RouterOS scripting language (`.rsc` files). Unlike most LSPs that ship with a built-in grammar, this one queries a **live RouterOS device** via HTTP REST API to get all syntax data — meaning it automatically supports any RouterOS version without updates.

This is the **most widely used tikoci project** (thousands of VSCode Marketplace installs). Treat code quality, test coverage, and release hygiene accordingly. "Works on my VSCode Desktop" is not sufficient — changes must hold up across all five deployment contexts below.

## Deployment Contexts (six, not three)

The codebase compiles to three build targets, but each change must be evaluated against six **deployment contexts** where users actually hit it:

1. **VSCode Desktop** (Marketplace + Open-VSX) — the largest user base; Node.js IPC.
2. **VSCode Web** (`vscode.dev`, `github.dev`) — Web Worker; no Node APIs; needs a CORS proxy for RouterOS.
3. **Standalone native binary** (GitHub Releases) — `bun build --compile`; for Helix and other LSP clients via `--stdio`.
4. **npm package** `@tikoci/routeroslsp` — Node-based stdio server; the recommended non-VSCode install path because it avoids macOS quarantine and is platform-independent.
5. **NeoVim** — consumes either the standalone binary or the npm package via stdio, but is first-class: it has its own init script (`nvim-routeros-lsp-init.lua`), its own README section, and its own `.github/instructions/neovim.instructions.md`. Changes to the standalone path must be validated against NeoVim explicitly — it's the canary for "does the stdio transport still work end-to-end outside VSCode".
6. **GitHub Copilot CLI** — consumes the LSP via `.github/lsp.json` (repo-level) or `~/.copilot/lsp-config.json` (user-level). This is an LSP client, not an MCP server; ambient credentials usually flow through `initializationOptions` because Copilot CLI does not implement `workspace/configuration`, with `ROUTEROSLSP_*` env vars as a standalone fallback.

See [`.github/instructions/deployment.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/deployment.instructions.md) for the per-context pre-release checklist.

## Architecture

### Three Build Targets

The same server code compiles to three targets:

| Target | Entry | Transport | Build |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------|
| VSCode Desktop | `server.ts` | Node IPC | `bun build` → CJS |
| VSCode Web | `server.web.ts` | BrowserMessageReader/Writer | `webpack` → Web Worker |
| Standalone | `server.ts` | `--stdio` / `--socket` | `bun build --compile` → native binary |

The client only exists for VSCode (desktop + web). Other editors use the standalone binary directly.

```

### Singleton Pattern

Both `LspController` and `RouterRestClient` use static `.default` singletons. One controller per session. One HTTP client per session (with Axios interceptors for logging/error recovery).

### Document Lifecycle

1. `onDidOpenTextDocument` → create `LspDocument` in `#lspDocuments` Map
2. `LspDocument` lazily fetches `highlightTokens` via `RouterRestClient.inspect('highlight', ...)`
3. Tokens cached until document changes → `onDidChangeTextDocument` → invalidate + re-fetch
4. On config change → all documents refreshed (clear cache, re-fetch)

### RouterOS API Interaction

All data comes from `POST /rest/console/inspect`:

| `request` value | What it returns | Used for |
|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| `highlight` | Token type per character (comma-separated) | Semantic tokens, diagnostics |
| `completion` | Completion items at cursor | Code completion |
| `syntax` | Command structure (dirs, cmds, args) | Not yet used (documented in README) |
| `child` | Child nodes of a path | Not yet used |

**Key gotchas:**
- RouterOS uses Windows-1252 encoding; the LSP converts non-ASCII (>127) to `?` before querying
- Documents >32KB are truncated (RouterOS API limit)
- Adding a fake space or `=` after input can expose arg completions or value definitions (see README "Implementation Tips")
- Response format varies significantly between `request` types — `highlight` is comma-delimited, others are structured JSON

### Client Architecture (VSCode Only)

The client is intentionally thin:
- `extension.ts` / `extension.web.ts` — Create `LanguageClient`, register commands, start watchdog
- `client.ts` — Document selectors for `.rsc`, `.tikbook`, notebook cells; multiple URI schemes
- `commands.ts` — Theme color application, settings navigation, new file creation
- `watchdog.ts` — Periodic `getIdentity()` ping with error mapping (ECONNREFUSED, 401, TLS, timeout)

### TikBook Integration

[vscode-tikbook](https://github.com/tikoci/tikbook) is the companion extension:
- TikBook includes this LSP in its `extensionPack`
- When `allowClientProvidedCredentials` is `true` (default), TikBook can override the ambient read-only credentials via `routeroslsp.server.useConnectionUrl`
- The watchdog detects this and adjusts error messages accordingly
- Document selectors include `rscena` URI scheme and tikbook file patterns for cross-extension support

## Build System

### Why Bun + Webpack

- **Bun** handles Node.js compilation (`bun build`) and standalone binary (`bun build --compile`)
- **Webpack** is required only for the web target (Web Worker bundling with polyfills like `path-browserify`)
- This is an intentional split: Bun can't bundle Web Workers, webpack can't compile standalone binaries

### Build Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `compile` | Full build: client + server + exe + web |
| `compile:client` | `bun build client/src/extension.ts` → CJS |
| `compile:server` | `bun build server/src/server.ts` → CJS |
| `compile:exe` | `bun build --compile server/src/server.ts` → native binary |
| `compile:web` | `webpack` → Web Worker bundles |
| `watch:node` | Dev mode: compile + watch server changes |
| `watch:web` | Dev mode: webpack watch |
| `vsix:package` | Package .vsix (runs compile + vsce) |
| `vsix:package:prerelease` | Package .vsix as pre-release (`--pre-release`) |
| `bun:exe` | Same as compile:exe + copies to ~/.bin/ |
| `lint` | `bun audit` + Biome check on server + client |
| `test` | `bun test tests/` |
| `bump:patch` | Sync patch version across root + server + client package.json |
| `bump:minor` | Sync minor version across root + server + client package.json |
| `npm:publish` | `compile:server` + prepend shebang + `npm publish` from server/ |

### CI / Release split (two workflows)

| Workflow | File | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| **CI** | `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` | `push` to `main`, `pull_request` to `main`, manual | Validation only: install → compile → test → lint → smoke. No packaging, no publish, no release. The "did we break the LSP?" signal between releases. |
| **Build and Release** | `.github/workflows/build.yaml` | `workflow_dispatch` (manual) | Release path: re-runs the CI gate, then packages VSIX, cross-compiles 8 standalone binaries, creates the GitHub Release, publishes to VSCode Marketplace + Open-VSX + npm, then bumps versions. |

The split exists because **releasing is a deliberate human action** — we don't want every push to ship — but **knowing the build/lint/test/smoke gate is green** matters between releases too. Before this split (`build.yaml` was workflow_dispatch-only), it was possible for a typecheck regression to land on `main` and only surface at release time. Now CI catches it on the push or PR.

`build.yaml` steps:

1. Setup Node 22 + Bun (with `registry-url` set for npm auth)
2. Install, build, lint
3. Package VSIX
4. Cross-compile standalone binaries for 8 platforms (Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, Linux musl, Windows x64/arm64)
5. Create GitHub Release with all artifacts
6. Publish VSIX to VSCode Marketplace and Open-VSX
7. Publish server package to npm as `@tikoci/routeroslsp` (if `NPM_TOKEN` secret is set)

If you change build/lint/test scripts or the smoke harness, **update both workflows** so the CI gate stays consistent with the release gate.

## Code Patterns

### Error Handling
- HTTP interceptors clear document cache on errors → forces re-fetch on next request
- `RouterOSClientError` interface (`code`, `message`, `status`) is the normalized error shape that crosses the LSP protocol boundary — avoids circular-reference crashes when serializing over JSON-RPC
- `normalizeError()` in `routeros.ts` converts `AxiosError`/`Error`/unknown into a plain `RouterOSClientError`
- Ambient `inspect*` and `execute` methods return `undefined` on error (graceful degradation); the strict validation/execute path used by internal write commands propagates `RouterOSClientError` instead. `getIdentity` also propagates the error (watchdog needs it)
- Diagnostics degrade gracefully: no tokens = empty array + log
- Watchdog maps error codes to user-friendly messages with action buttons; `toErrorInfo()` helper safely extracts fields from any error shape

### Async Patterns
- `readyResolver` Promise gates all handlers until initialization completes
- `LspDocument.highlightTokens` is a lazy Promise — evaluated once, cached until invalidated
- All LSP handlers `await controller.isReady` before processing

### Logging
- `log.debug()`, `log.info()`, `log.warn()`, `log.error()` from `shared.ts`
- Backed by LSP `connection.console.*`
- HTTP request/response logging in Axios interceptors

## Testing

Tests live in `tests/server/` and `tests/client/` (mirroring the source tree). Run with `bun run test` or `bun test tests/`.

### Test tiers

| Tier | Files | What it tests | CHR required? |
|------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Unit | `controller.test.ts`, `tokens.test.ts`, `routeros.test.ts`, `shared.test.ts` | Pure functions, static methods, settings lifecycle | No |
| Model | `model.test.ts` | `LspDocument.diagnostics()` with mocked `inspectHighlight` | No |
| Snapshot | `snapshot.test.ts` | Token parsing against saved `.rsc.highlight` files | No |
| Client | `watchdog-errors.test.ts` | `toErrorInfo`/`getTextFromError` error mapping | No |
| Integration | `integration.test.ts` | Full highlight pipeline against live CHR for all `test-data/**/*.rsc` | Yes |

### Key details

- `bunfig.toml` configures a preload (`tests/test-preload.ts`) that silences `log.*` output during tests
- Integration tests auto-skip when no CHR is reachable (default `http://192.168.74.150`, override via `ROUTEROS_TEST_URL`)
- `scripts/capture-snapshots.ts` is a CLI tool (`bun run scripts/capture-snapshots.ts`) that regenerates `.highlight` snapshot files from a live CHR
- `test-data/` is committed — snapshot `.highlight` files and scripts are available in CI for offline tests
- Snapshot tests revealed unknown token types `arg-scope`, `arg-dot` — not yet in `HighlightTokens.TokenTypes` (see BACKLOG)
- See [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) for remaining testing work (VSCode integration tests, CI snapshot capture)

## CHANGELOG.md

`CHANGELOG.md` is user-facing — it's displayed as "Release Notes" in the VSCode extension UI. Write for extension users, not developers.

Each release has **Changes** (user-visible features/improvements) and **Fixes** (bug fixes). Update the changelog when making user-visible changes. Don't log version bumps, CI-only changes, or individual lint fixes. Refactors are worth a summarized bullet under Fixes since users may correlate behavior changes. See `.github/instructions/changelog.instructions.md` for full conventions.

## LSP Capabilities Implemented

| LSP Feature | Status | Handler in controller.ts |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------|
| Completion | ✅ Working | `#onCompletion` |
| Semantic Tokens | ✅ Working | `#generateSemanticTokens` |
| Diagnostics | ✅ Working | `#handleDiagnostics` |
| Hover | ⚠️ Basic (shows token type) | `#onHover` |
| Document Symbols | ⚠️ Basic (variables only) | `#onDocumentSymbols` |
| Execute Commands | ✅ Working (6 commands) | `onExecuteCommand` |
| Inlay Hints | 🚫 Removed (dead code cleaned up) | — |
| Definition/References | 🚫 Not implemented | — |
| Formatting | 🚫 Not implemented | — |
| Code Actions | 🚫 Not implemented | — |

See [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) for planned LSP feature additions.

## Known Gotchas

1. **Handler naming**: Handlers are private class methods (`#onCompletion`, `#onHover`, etc.) — not public or arrow-function properties. Don't reference old names like `onCompletionHandler`.
2. **32KB document limit**: RouterOS API truncates large scripts. The LSP silently truncates at this boundary.
3. **Unicode → underscore replacement**: Non-ASCII characters replaced with `?` before sending to RouterOS. Character indexes must be preserved carefully.
4. **Self-signed TLS**: Node.js uses `rejectUnauthorized: false` by default. Web target cannot bypass certificate checks — requires CORS proxy.
5. **Full document sync**: Every keystroke sends the full document to RouterOS for re-highlighting. No incremental sync.
6. **No offline mode**: Without a RouterOS connection, the LSP does nothing. Don't try to add fallback syntax — it would be version-specific and wrong.
7. **Webpack for web only**: Don't try to use webpack for the Node target or bun for the web target.
